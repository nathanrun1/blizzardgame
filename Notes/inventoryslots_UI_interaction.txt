inventoryslots support UI interactions that move items between slots

events:

MoveOut: Request to move item out. If approved, runs MoveIn on other slot. If that's approved, do necessary data changes.

MoveIn: Request to move item in. If slot not empty, request movein on origin slot with arg that indicates its a swap. If approved, do necessary data changes.

MoveOut provides destination slot and amount moved.

MoveIn provides origin slot and amount moved, and whether or not its a swap (i.e. if movein had been sent from this slot to that slot already).

E.g. within inventory, inventory checks if UI slot is also in inventory, if so checks index and does it internally.

E.g. btwn furnace and inventory, inventory -> furnace. Furnace receives it, checks if item matches what can go in slot (if u want), and then approves if its a valid source, i.e. from inventory with sanity check. 

MoveIn and MoveOut are delegates, since they need a return value to continue within the implementation.

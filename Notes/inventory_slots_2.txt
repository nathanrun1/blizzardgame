ok what we doin


whats the most efficient thing I can do rn to accelerate game completion
nah lowkey tho... the UI is pretty useful for interactions


basically make it so that inventory slots can do shit easily

rn: linking inventory slot to a true slot

what abt shift clicking and stuff? hmmm
can robably implement it by having some kind of state

but whatever thats QoL fuck that shit, just implement the item transfer for now

ah right theres also like the intermediate stack, like draggin from spots. but whatever bro, thats also QoL

todo:

[ ]: add shift as input (mainly for testing rn but also for later stuff)
[X]: test item transfer, make it work fully
[ ]: drag and drop

add shift click drag for whole stack, click drag for one
UI detect click drag, duplicates the item icon, adjusts slot one based on how much is "left"
on drop, checks if mouse above slot. If so, attempt move. Afterwards reset the slot.
